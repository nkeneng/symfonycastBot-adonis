# symfonycastBot-adonis
>the web app of my symfonycast bot created with puppeteer and adonis js 

# Stack used in this project
* **Puppeteer** for the scrapping process
* **React Js + Tailwind** for the client interface
* **Adonis Js** for the backend side
* **Socket.io** for the realtime progress indicator

## Why I started this project
First , I wanted to learn web automation and decide to create a project different from those found on YouTube tutorials
<br>
I saw that puppeteer was a good tool for scrapping process and was using javascript which I kind of love
<br>
The fact that puppeteer was requiring nodejs for a good way for me to start and learn using node js frameworks to build webapp
<br>
I chose Adonis Js because it was almost similar to what I was using on a daily basis (**SYMFONY**)
<br>
I also wanted to learn how to start in the concept of realtime apps using websockets and how to integrate it in a nodejs framework and a client side library like React

# What I learned
* To use Adonis Js to build backend app 
* To integrate Websocket in Adonis Js which is not include by default ðŸ˜‚
* To integrate react and Adonis js as a mono repo
* To configure webpack to make react work with socket.io-client
* To use Socket.io both from Backend as from Frontend
* To start a new Thread on node js ( but I didn't use it finally)

> The project was really rich in new features and technology for me, and I think I will stay by my traditional way of building backend apps with **symfony** unless some features required nodejs like puppeteer
